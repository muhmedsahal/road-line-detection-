# Road Line Detection

This project implements a road line detection system using OpenCV and Python. It processes video input to identify and highlight road lane markings in real-time.

## Features

- Video capture and processing
- Color filtering to isolate yellow lane lines
- Gaussian blur for noise reduction
- Edge detection using Canny algorithm
- Line detection with Hough transform
- Dynamic visualization of detected lanes

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
